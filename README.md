### Anomaly Detection (w/ Network Detection dataset) using tinyML

#### Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/anushonkar/network-anamoly-detection?select=Train.txt

#### In this project we will be classifying the Network data as normal (encoded as label 1) or attack (encoded as label 0) by training a tensorflow model, and then loading the model in a microcontroller and observing the accuracy of classification in the serial monitor.
